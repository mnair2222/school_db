School Management System is a PHP-based web application built with XAMPP and MySQL. It allows managing students and classes, with features to add, view, edit, and delete students, upload profile images, and manage class details. To set up, clone the repository, create a school_db database in PHPMyAdmin, configure database credentials in config.php, and run the project on http://localhost/school_demo/. Place the project in C:/xampp/htdocs/ for it to work. The project structure includes core files like index.php, create.php, view.php, edit.php, delete.php, and classes.php.
